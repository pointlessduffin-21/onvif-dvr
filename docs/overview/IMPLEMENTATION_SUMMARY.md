## 📊 How It Works

### Live Streaming Flow
```
RTSP Camera → ffmpeg process → HLS segments → Browser (HLS.js) → Video Player
             (stream_manager.py)  (static/streams/)
```

1. User clicks "Play" on a camera stream
2. Frontend calls `/api/streams/start` with camera_id and profile_token
3. Backend starts ffmpeg subprocess to convert RTSP to HLS
4. ffmpeg generates .m3u8 playlist and .ts video segments
5. Frontend loads playlist with HLS.js
6. Video plays in browser

### DVR Recording Search Flow
```
User Search → Flask API → Recording Manager → ONVIF Camera → DVR Database → Results
             (app.py)      (recording_manager.py)  (Profile G)
```

1. User selects camera and time range
2. Frontend calls `/api/cameras/<id>/recordings/search`
3. Backend uses ONVIF Search service to query DVR
4. DVR returns recording metadata
5. User can request playback URI for any recording
6. System retrieves RTSP URL for that recording

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Stream Manager Key Components

**Stream Start**:
- Creates unique stream ID: `camera{id}_{profile_token}`
- Launches ffmpeg with optimized HLS settings
- Stores process reference and metadata
- Returns playlist URL to frontend

**Stream Stop**:
- Terminates ffmpeg process gracefully
- Cleans up HLS segments
- Removes from active streams registry

**ffmpeg Command**:
```bash
ffmpeg -rtsp_transport tcp \
  -i rtsp://user:pass@camera/stream \
  -c:v copy \          # No re-encoding (fast)
  -c:a aac \           # AAC audio (browser compatible)
  -f hls \             # HLS format
  -hls_time 2 \        # 2-second segments
  -hls_list_size 10 \  # Keep 10 segments
  -hls_flags delete_segments+append_list \
  output.m3u8
```

### Recording Manager Key Components

**Search Recordings**:
- Uses ONVIF Search service (`CreateSearch`, `FindRecordings`)
- Queries by time range and optional recording token
- Paginates results (up to 100 matches)
- Returns structured recording metadata

**Get Summary**:
- Uses ONVIF Recording service (`GetRecordings`)
- Lists all available recordings on device
- Includes track information (video/audio)
- Shows earliest and latest recording times

**Get Playback URI**:
- Uses ONVIF Replay service (`GetReplayUri`)
- Returns RTSP URL for specific recording
- Supports time range filtering
- Compatible with standard RTSP players

## 🎯 Usage Instructions

2. Click "View" on any online camera
3. Select stream quality (MainStream/SubStream)
4. Click "Play" button
5. Wait 2-3 seconds for initialization
6. Video plays automatically
7. Click "Stop" when done

### For DVR Recordings
1. Navigate to `/recordings`
2. Select a camera
3. View recording summary in sidebar
4. Set date/time range or use quick search
5. Click "Search"
6. Click "Play" on any recording
7. Modal shows playback information

## 🔍 ONVIF Recording Explanation

### Two Recording Approaches

**1. DVR/NVR Storage (Profile G) - Implemented**:
- ✅ Recordings stored on camera's hard drives
- ✅ ONVIF Profile G allows remote search and playback
- ✅ No additional storage needed on server
- ✅ Perfect for Dahua XVR with built-in storage
- ⚠️ Requires Profile G support on camera
- ⚠️ Storage limited by camera's hard drive capacity

**2. Client-Side Recording (Custom) - Not Implemented**:
- ❌ Server captures and stores RTSP streams
- ❌ Uses ffmpeg to save video files
- ❌ Requires significant server storage
- ❌ Server manages retention policies
- ✅ Full control over recordings
- ✅ Works with any camera

**Your Dahua XVR**: Uses approach #1 (Profile G). It records all 16 channels to internal hard drives, and we can search/playback those recordings via ONVIF.

## 🚀 What's Working Now

1. ✅ Live RTSP streams converted to HLS for browser playback
2. ✅ All 16 Dahua XVR channels accessible with 2 quality levels each
3. ✅ Search recordings on DVR by date/time range
4. ✅ View recording summary and available sources
5. ✅ Get playback URIs for recorded footage
6. ✅ Automatic ffmpeg process management
7. ✅ Stream cleanup on stop
8. ✅ HLS.js integration with error recovery

## 🔮 Future Enhancements

1. **Recording HLS Conversion**: Convert DVR playback streams to HLS (currently returns RTSP URL)
2. **Snapshot Feature**: Capture still images from live streams
3. **Client-Side Recording**: Option to record streams on server
4. **Multi-View**: Grid layout for multiple camera streams
5. **Motion Detection**: Integrate OpenCV for motion detection
6. **Smart Search**: Find recordings with specific events/objects
7. **Export Tools**: Download recordings in various formats
8. **Bandwidth Optimization**: Adaptive bitrate streaming
9. **Mobile Optimization**: Touch controls and responsive design
10. **Recording Download**: Direct download of DVR recordings

## 🐛 Known Limitations

1. Recording playback currently shows RTSP URL (needs HLS conversion)
2. No snapshot feature yet (needs frame extraction)
3. No concurrent stream limit (could exhaust resources)
4. No automatic cleanup of old HLS segments (retention policy needed)
5. ONVIF Recording service may not work on all cameras (Profile G required)
6. No authentication on HLS stream URLs (security consideration)
7. No stream quality auto-switching based on bandwidth

## 💡 Testing

### Test Live Streaming
```bash
# 1. Open browser to http://localhost:5001
# 2. Go to Cameras → View on Dahua XVR
# 3. Select MainStream or SubStream
# 4. Click Play
# 5. Verify video plays within 2-3 seconds
# 6. Check stream status updates
# 7. Click Stop and verify cleanup
```

### Test Recording Search
```bash
# 1. Go to Recordings page
# 2. Select Dahua XVR camera
# 3. View recording summary (should show 16+ sources)
# 4. Set time range (last 24 hours)
# 5. Click Search
# 6. Verify results appear
# 7. Click Play on any recording
# 8. Modal should show RTSP URL
```

### Test ffmpeg Process
```bash
# Check active streams
curl http://localhost:5001/api/streams/all

# Start a stream manually
curl -X POST http://localhost:5001/api/streams/start \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"camera_id": 1, "profile_token": "MediaProfile00000"}'

# Check if ffmpeg is running
ps aux | grep ffmpeg

# Check HLS files
ls -lh static/streams/camera1_MediaProfile00000/

# Stop stream
curl -X POST http://localhost:5001/api/streams/stop \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"stream_id": "camera1_MediaProfile00000"}'
```

## 📝 Summary

You now have a **fully functional ONVIF viewer** with:
- ✅ **Live streaming** via ffmpeg HLS conversion
- ✅ **DVR recording search** using ONVIF Profile G
- ✅ **Browser-based playback** with HLS.js
- ✅ **All 16 channels** from your Dahua XVR accessible
- ✅ **Recording summary** showing available footage

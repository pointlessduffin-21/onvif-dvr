# Bug Fixes - Streaming & Recording

## Issues Fixed

### 1. RTSP URLs Missing Authentication ✅

**Problem**: Stream URIs from ONVIF didn't include username/password, causing authentication failures.

**Solution**: Modified `stream_manager.py` to inject credentials into RTSP URL:
```python
if username and password:
    if '://' in rtsp_uri:
        protocol, rest = rtsp_uri.split('://', 1)
        rtsp_uri = f"{protocol}://{username}:{password}@{rest}"
```

**Result**: URLs now look like:
```
rtsp://admin:1qaz2wsx@192.168.1.108:554/cam/realmonitor?channel=1&subtype=0...
```

---

### 2. WSDL Path Hardcoded Incorrectly ❌ → ✅

**Problem**: `recording_manager.py` had hardcoded path:
```python
'/usr/local/lib/python3.13/site-packages/wsdl/'
```

But actual location on macOS with Python.org install:
```
'/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.13/lib/python3.13/site-packages/wsdl/'
```

**Solution**: Auto-detect WSDL path from multiple possible locations:
```python
possible_paths = [
    '/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.13/lib/python3.13/site-packages/wsdl/',
    '/usr/local/lib/python3.13/site-packages/wsdl/',
    os.path.join(sys.prefix, 'lib', f'python{sys.version_info.major}.{sys.version_info.minor}', 'site-packages', 'wsdl'),
]

wsdl_path = None
for path in possible_paths:
    if os.path.exists(os.path.join(path, 'devicemgmt.wsdl')):
        wsdl_path = path
        break
```

**Result**: Works on different Python installations (Homebrew, Python.org, pyenv, etc.)

---

### 3. HLS Playlist URL Path Incorrect ❌ → ✅

**Problem**: HLS playlist URL was constructed as:
```
/streams/camera1_MediaProfile00000/stream.m3u8
```

But Flask route expected:
```
/static/streams/camera1_MediaProfile00000/stream.m3u8
```

**Root Cause**: In `stream_manager.py`, line 103:
```python
'playlist': str(playlist_path.relative_to(self.output_dir.parent))
```

This created path `streams/camera.../stream.m3u8` instead of `static/streams/camera.../stream.m3u8`

**Solution**: Fixed playlist path construction:
```python
relative_playlist = f"static/streams/{stream_id}/stream.m3u8"
self.active_streams[stream_id] = {
    'process': process,
    'uri': rtsp_uri,
    'started_at': time.time(),
    'playlist': relative_playlist
}
```

**Result**: Browser now correctly requests `/static/streams/.../stream.m3u8`

## Testing the Fixes

### Test Live Streaming
1. Go to http://localhost:5001
2. Click "Cameras" → "View" on Dahua XVR
3. Select any stream (MainStream or SubStream)
4. Click "Play"
5. **Expected**: Video starts playing within 2-3 seconds
6. Check browser network tab: Should see requests to `/static/streams/.../stream.m3u8` and `.../segment_*.ts`

### Test Recording Search
1. Go to http://localhost:5001/recordings
2. Select "Cubeworks Office" camera
3. **Expected**: Recording summary loads without errors
4. Set date range and click "Search"
5. **Expected**: Search completes and shows results (if recordings exist)

## Log Evidence

### Before Fixes
```
ERROR:recording_manager:Failed to connect to camera 192.168.1.108:80: Unknown error: No such file: /usr/local/lib/python3.13/site-packages/wsdl/devicemgmt.wsdl

INFO:werkzeug:127.0.0.1 - - [06/Oct/2025 17:16:43] "GET /streams/camera1_MediaProfile00000/stream.m3u8 HTTP/1.1" 404 -
```

### After Fixes
```
INFO:stream_manager:Started stream camera1_MediaProfile00000 from rtsp://admin:1qaz2wsx@192.168.1.108:554/cam/realmonitor?channel=1&subtype=0&unicast=true&proto=Onvif

```

## Files Modified

1. **stream_manager.py**
   - Added credential injection to RTSP URLs
   - Fixed playlist path construction

2. **recording_manager.py**
   - Added auto-detection for WSDL directory
   - Supports multiple Python installation paths

---

## Additional Notes

### Why Credentials Need to be in URL
- ffmpeg doesn't support separate authentication parameters for RTSP
- Must be embedded in URL: `rtsp://user:pass@host:port/path`
- The `start_stream()` method injects these automatically from camera database record

### Why WSDL Path Matters
- `onvif-zeep` library requires WSDL files to generate SOAP requests
- Different Python installations put packages in different locations
- Auto-detection ensures it works everywhere

### Why Path Construction is Critical
- Flask serves static files from project root
- URL `/static/streams/...` maps to filesystem `./static/streams/...`
- HLS.js client must request correct URL to fetch playlist and segments

---

## Verification Commands

```bash
# Check if stream is running
ps aux | grep ffmpeg

# Check HLS files are being created
ls -lh static/streams/camera1_MediaProfile00000/

# Monitor file updates
watch -n 1 ls -lh static/streams/camera1_MediaProfile00000/

# Check Flask logs
# Look for "Started stream" messages with full RTSP URL including credentials

# Test WSDL path detection
python3 -c "
import os
import sys
possible_paths = [
    '/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.13/lib/python3.13/site-packages/wsdl/',
    '/usr/local/lib/python3.13/site-packages/wsdl/',
]
for path in possible_paths:
    if os.path.exists(os.path.join(path, 'devicemgmt.wsdl')):
        print(f'Found WSDL at: {path}')
        break
"
```

## Summary

All three critical bugs are now fixed:
1. ✅ RTSP authentication works
2. ✅ ONVIF Recording service can connect
3. ✅ HLS playback URLs are correct

The application should now fully support:
- Live video streaming with proper authentication
- DVR recording search via ONVIF Profile G
- Browser-based HLS playback
